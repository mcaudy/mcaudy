    Wrap rule inputs and outputs which may be local paths or remote URLs.

    Automatically maps well-known URL schemes to the appropriate remote
    providers in the ``snakemake.remote.*`` classes.  The returned objects
    should be interchangeable for most rules.  For example:

    ::

        rule align:
            input: path_or_url(config["sequences"])
            output: "results/aligned.fasta"

                augur align --sequences {input} --output {output} â€¦
                '''

    If ``config["sequences"]`` is a URL, then Snakemake will first temporarily
    download the referenced file to a local path and then substitute that local
    path as the new value of ``input`` when running the ``shell`` block.

    See `https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/remote_files.html`__
    for more information on Snakemake's remote files support, including the
    supported keyword args ``keep_local`` and ``stay_on_remote``.
